# Some Image Quality Algorithms
demosaic.py - Simple demosaic algorithm to separate 3 channels and create a RGB image.

Global_thresolding.py - Implementation of Global Thresholding algorithm.

SNR.py - simulate different types of noise and measure SNR to estimate the impact.

USM_.py - Unsharp masking algorithm to enhance the sharpness of an image.

denoising.py - Implement Median Filtering and its variation to oversome Salt Pepper noise and observe impact on image after denoising.

func_ImageEq.py - Create and apply the Histogram Equalization function on an image.

func_imageResizing.py / image_resize.py - Resize/ decimate image (impacts the resolution)

geometric_transformation.py - apply the transformation matrix to apply scaling, rotation, translation and other imaging parameters to an image.

sobel.py - Apply Sobel. Prewitt and Laplacian operators on an image.

stack_image.py - stack images based on an input from user.
